Clinical Appointment Management System enables the user to book appointments , get their medical reports in a hassle-free manner. It provides easy access to doctor’s timings, availability
and holidays.
 The idea behind this project is to provide the clinic with a database system with the help of which it can get rid of manual procedures.
 A system is needed that can maintain the patient’s name, age, doctor they wish to book an appointment with, appointment time & date, the patient’s medical report,
 prescription details and the list of laboratory tests.
